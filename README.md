# UFOs
Javascript Project for Data Visualization

## Overview of the analysis:
For this project a webpage is created to display UFO sightings information that can be filtered according to the user's criteria.

### Objective
* Generate a dynamic table that takes multiple criteria at the same time to showcase UFO sightings information. 

## Results:

In order to filter the data a function was created to keep track of all the filters, in that way filters for each of the following elements could be used:

* Date: Enter the date in the following format mm/dd/yyyy to display the sighthings from a specific day.
* City: Enter the name of a specific city to narrow the results further. The search is cap sensitive so the city name must be enter in lowercase. 
* State: Enter the state two letter abbreviation code to limit the search to a state.
* Country: Enter the state two letter abbreviation code to limit the search to a state.
* Shape: Enter a specific shape like sphere, fireball or disk to reduce the search to a specific alien pattern.

Search Example:
1. Table without filters.

2. Reducing the search by date. Showing results only for January 1st 2010 (1/1/2010).

3. Applying the filter only to sighthings in California. The following image shows results for January 1st 2010 in California only.



## Summary:
* Currently the data set used only contains a limited amount of information, thus some of the filters do not provide any visualization improvements such as the "country" filter, since all entries correspond to the US.
